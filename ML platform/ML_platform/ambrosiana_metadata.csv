The Kiss,Francesco Hayez (1791-1882),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hayez_ilbacio-1024x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Kiss.jpg,,dopo 1859,Painting,,"26,2 x 22,1 cm",,,19,"This watercolour, signed on the right in the center “Hayez Fran.co”, is not a preparatory study indeed, but a d’après from a particularly appreciated painting, according to a frequent practice of Hayez. It is the famous The kiss. Episode of youth. Costumes of the XIV century (Milan, Pinacoteca di Brera), presented in 1859 at the annual exhibition of the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera. The watercolor is quite faithful to the original, except for the simplified background.
The artist painted it as a gift for his dear friend Giuseppina Negroni Prati Morosini. The work is mentioned for the first time in the collection of the Vincenzo Negroni Prati Morosini heirs in 1962 and in the same year it entered the Ambrosiana collections, together with four portraits of the same family executed by Hayez himself, including that of Giuseppina Negroni Prati Morosini."
llias picta,NA,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Combattimento-del-V-Libro-Diomede-assistito-da-Atena-ferisce-Fegeo-1024x884.jpg,ambrosiana_images/llias_picta.jpg,,,Manoscritto,,,,,NA,"The little paper Codex came to the Ambrosiana library in the autumn of 1609 with the astonishing collection of manuscripts belonged to Gian Vincenzo Pinelli and acquired by Cardinal Federico Borromeo after lengthy negotiations.
It was a schoolbook, with the right-hand side of each page taken up with narrative and etiological comments and explanations concerning the Iliad, and the left by the miniatures, all arranged facing the left. In the early XIX century, the parchment fragments were detached from the supporting papers and were thus available to new scholarly studies. It was immediately clear that they had been cut out of a Codex of the Iliad, as splendid as ever as unique, so that there were almost no other relics of the ancient world with which they could be compared, to help with dating the book and guessing where it might have been produced.
Paleographic research led to the era of the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I (491-518), when a type of script known as biblical majuscule, used mainly for the transmission of Christian texts, featured the chiaroscuro and ornamentation of the letters used by the Ilias Picta copyist. But the copyist applied them in a style called rounded uncial, the fine script of profane literature, out of use for three centuries. Careful studies on the miniatures revealed they were neither originals, nor copied from a single model, but rather composites of different elements and traditions in the figurative arts and craftsmanship, datable to between the second and the fifth centuries AD: hence the difference among the miniatures, all apparently from the hand of a single good craftsman.
As for the provenance of the Ilias Picta, comparisons with the similar script of the same period in two parchment fragments, one found in Egypt and the other possibly reused there in the seventh or eighth century to write a Coptic text, lead us to favor Alexandria. Such a work had to be carried out in a city, where there were patrons and wealthy cultured clients, libraries and an artistic heritage to provide models for the script, text and miniatures, as well as at least one copyist and a miniaturist capable of doing the work. It was then during the Byzantine period in Calabria and Sicily at the height of the twelfth century that the small Homeric manual was prepared and the surviving miniatures cut and pasted from their original folios."
The Ambrosian Virgil of Francesco Petrarca,NA,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Frontespizio-del-Virgilio-Ambrosiano-o-Virgilio-del-Petrarca-con-note-autografe-di-Francesco-Petrarca-686x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Ambrosian_Virgil_of_Francesco_Petrarca.jpg,,1300-1326,,,41O x 265 mm,,,Non esposta,"In the course of his active scholarly life, Francesco Petrarca – Pe­trarch – amassed an enviable library embracing both his beloved classical authors and the Church Fathers. He sought out texts that were little known at that point; he wove friendships that allowed him gradually to increase the number of volumes in his armarium. With his notes on his own reading, and the textual collations and conjectural readings he added in the margins of his books, he put back into circulation many works not often read in the Middle Ages: Livy’s Decades is a case in point, as are some of Cicero’s orations such as the Pro Archia. The most famous manuscript in his possession, the Ambrosian Virgil, was acquired for the Am­brosiana Library at the behest of Cardinal Federico Borromeo.
The fame of this codex is linked to the ‘Virgilian allegory’, a miniature by the Sienese painter Simone Martini, which Petrarch chose as a delightful gateway to the volume, and above all to the eight lines on the verso of the front cover in which he laments the fate of Laura."
Naturalis Historia,Plinio il Vecchio (23-79 dC),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Pagina-miniata-con-capolettera-M-della-Naturalis-Historia-763x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Naturalis_Historia.jpg,,1389,Manoscritto,,39 × 27 cm,,,Non esposta,"This edition of Pliny’s Naturalis Historia was part of the collection of Pasquino Capelli, one of the most famous bibliophiles at Gian Galeazzo Visconti’s court. His story, sadly, is well known. A lover of the classics and a great collector of manuscripts, which he sought out during his travels, particularly in France, he was often sent on diplomatic missions as Chancellor to the Duke. For reasons we still do not know today, he fell out of favour with Gian Galeazzo and ended his days in prison, where he was executed in 1399. The Duke also took possession of his large collection of manuscripts, which were added to the Visconti library in the same way as other no less prestigious collections, such as those of Francesco il Vecchio of Car­rara and even Petrarch."

Libro d’Ore Borromeo,Cristoforo de Predis (1440-1486),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Libro-d-Ore-Borromeo-737x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Libro_d’Ore_Borromeo.jpg,,,Manoscritto,,,,,NA,"Cardinal Federico Borromeo was particularly fond of this prayer book, which was almost a family heirloom. It contained his family’s coats of arms and the portraits of the two ancestors who had commis­sioned it, Count Giovanni III Borromeo (1439-95) and his wife Cle­ofa Pio da Carpi, which he recognised in the bas de page miniature decoration that introduces Matins in the Office of the Virgin (fol. 16r).
The Book of Hours is richly illuminated, even in the friezes, often on gold leaf, with elegant filigree decoration in the margins, done in pen and ink on many folios. It is a codex that boasts the signature of one of the most famous masters in Lombardy during of the Sforza period, Cristoforo de Predis (c. 1443-ante 24 january 1486). His name appears in fact on fol. 15v, in the folio with the Marriage of the Virgin, which contains in its margins the family coats of arms, a silver bit on a red field (today almost illegible) and a lion rampant on an azure field, and in the centre the em­blem of a resting camel with a plumed crown on its hump. A mar­riage that alludes to another marriage, that of Isabella Borromeo and Francesco Attendalo Bolognini. The prayer book could have been produced in the years 1480-1485 as a splendid gift for the second marriage of Isabelle. The Book of Hours, the book far lay piety, often features as a wedding gift and it is not surpris­ing to find it mentioned, along with a few other books of devotion, in dowry inventories of many young women of the Milanese bour­geoisie and aristocracy. The same Cristoforo de Predis had been called by the Borromeo family to produce another two little books of hours, for Francesco and Vitaliano, between 1471 and 1474, un­fortunately unidentified or currently lost, but documented in the family account books."
Noctes Atticae,Aulo Gellio,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-16-uomini-dotti-intorno-ad-Aulo-Gellio-696x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Noctes_Atticae.jpg,,1448,Miniatura,,340 x 240 mm,,,NA,"This lavish illuminated edition of Aulus Gellius’Noctes Acticae was made for a patron whose name we unfortunately do not know. The crest, which is set in a laurel wreath between two athletic put­ti in the bas-de-page on fol. 91r, and illuminated with a rinceau in the pure Ferrara style, has not yet been identified. The manu­script may have belonged to a physician or a natural philosopher. Many notes in the margin of the text explain the technical and scientific terms used. The choice of this work by Gellius, with its we­alth of information about the philosophical and scientific knowled­ge of the Ancients, also suggests it was far a man of science. This was a well-known text in the Middle Ages. We know that Guarino da Verona owned a copy, from which our codex may have been ta­ken, and Angelo Decembrio takes it as a model for his De politia litteraria.
The colophon (fol. 419v) shows that the copyist, who is also anonymous, finished his work in Bologna in 1448, “indictione un­ decima. pridie calendas julii” – in other words, on 30 June. The illuminator was Guglielmo Giraldi, who proudly places his signature in the margin of the illumination on fol. 90v: CVL D F P, Gulielmus de Ferraria pinxit. The illustration shows a swee­ping urban view, described with exquisite clarity in its perspective lines, with neatly arranged buildings that appear almost to form a stage setting: the actors can be seen in a square, and a central stre­et opens up between two architectural wings, leading up to the ca­stle we can just make out on the hill. On the left, there is a pier with boats. The illuminator has imagined Athens, where the learned as­sembly is taking place, even though the city – almost “Albertian” in its shapes – recalls the concept of the ideal city. It pays tribute lo Ve­nice by citing the two columns on the pier with the statues of a young man and of a lion, the latter holding a cartouche bearing the words “Civitas Athena(rum) “. This description of the city, which is rationally laid out, is however not without its Gothic overtones, as we see in the building giving onto the sea, with its curious avant­-corps with column-bearing lions and a dome hidden by a tall pedi­ment."

The inscriptions that accompany the sculpture are important: the name of the Greek philosopher appears on the lunette at the top, and it returns very clearly at the base of the niche, next to the head. A long inscription along the edges of the niche gives us the name of the sculptor, who was himself a member of the Piatti family, and the date the work was made (1478). Lastly, the cartouche in the philosopher’s hand bears a text that sums up Plato’s theory of the body as the prison of the soul."

Recently it has also been suggested that it is a portrait of Atalante Migliorotti, a Tuscan musician who was a friend of Leonardo and who came with him to the Duke’s court in Milan as a singer and talented lyrist."

The figures we see are clearly divided into two groups: a group of musicians, who are apterous (wingless) angels, are playing instruments reproduced very faithfully, though without strings. In the group of worshippers, we can see on our left a figure – the only one, with the exception of the angels – who is not looking straight at the Child, but rather at the woman in the foreground on the right. In the past, various scholars suggested three different identities for this person – Emperor Augustus, the poet Virgil and the god Apollo. Here we believe that it is, without any doubt, Apollo. He is identified by a laurel wreath and his long, characteristic torch, which precisely reproduces the many examples that are shown in Greek and Roman artefacts. This Apollo, now old and ugly, leans on his extinguished torch under a dead branch, which symbolises the end of paganism. However, the way he looks at the woman standing in the foreground on the right, who is quite probably a sibyl, and who is in turn looking at the Child, appears to be an invitation to consider the classical age as a good and necessary preparation for the age of Christ. This was a common idea already in the Middle Ages, and it is no coincidence that it is a classical-style arch that forms the backdrop for the scene. The work also contains an important Mariological aspect, for close observation of the geometry of the composition shows how the Virgin and Child are perfectly inscribed within an isosceles triangle, thus symbolising a particular theological doctrine, which is that of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, according to which the Mother of God was preserved from original sin. This might also be confirmed by two further aspects: one is the presence of Saint Francis (identified by his stigmata) and Saint Bernardino of Siena, for it is known that the Franciscans maintained this theological aspect in their preaching. The other is the presence of Salome behind the Madonna, next to Joseph. She is identified by her shrivelled hand, which she received as a midwife for not believing in the virgin birth, as we are told in the apocryphal Gospel of James (the presence of this figure in a Nativity has a precedent in the one made by Robert Campin in 1425, now in the Musée des Beaux Arts in Dijon). The painless delivery of Mary is a sign that she is free from the curse on Eve for having committed the original sin (“in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children”, according to the Book of Genesis). Lastly, it should be noted how the decoration on the capital on the pilaster of the arch recalls that of the capitals on the pilasters in the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro, which was built by Bramante, and thus a clear tribute by Bramantino to his illustrious master."

The splendid “pavilion” or tent, is one of the most important Biblical symbols in both the Old Testament (the “tent of meeting” as the place of the presence of God) and in the New Testament (in the Gospel of John, to summarise the mystery of the incarnation, we read that “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us”, in which the original literally means “dwelt as in a tent”). The two angels who open the “tent” thus reveal the mystery of the incarnation: the Son of God, who has become a child, born of the Virgin Mother."

Following the Cardinal’s statement, the portrait was for long assumed to depict Beatrice d’Este, the wife of Ludovico il Moro. However, scholars have recently been more cautious and vague in their statements, with regard to both the artist (anonymous Lombard or Emilian painter) and the and the identity of the young lady. These controversies never diminished the work’s appeal, but just increased its mystery."

The Ambrosiana manuscript is a codex on parchment with 130 folios in elegant humanistic script, and bears the date 14 December 1498. It was donated to the library in 1637 by Marquis Galeazzo Arconati, along with other Leonardo manuscripts including the renowned Codex Atlanticus.
As the title indicates, the main subject of the treatise is the study of the golden section, where a segment ( a-b) can be divided into un­ equal parts ( a-e and c-b) so that the whole is to the greater part as that part is to the smaller part ( a-b : a-e = a-e : c-b ).
The mathematicians of antiquity and the Greek philosophers were already fascinated by this curious ratio, which appeared to re­flect perfection and divine harmony: hence the use of the adjec­tive “divine” to describe the “proportion” governing this unique re­lationship.
Leonardo da Vinci, who met Luca Pacioli at the court of Ludovico il Moro in Milan in the late fifteenth century, has left visi­ble proof of how applying the golden section to solid geometry could become an opportunity for the creation of a splendid work of art. In fact, the mathematician monk directly commissioned from the Florentine great master a series of drawings of sixty solids, construct­ed on the basis of the golden section and painted in watercolours, and the result, thanks to the interplay of perspective and colours, was a fascinating series of geometric figures united by the common idea of perfection.
Each drawing becomes a true watercolour painting. The solid is shown, in compliance with the laws of gravity, hanging from a scroll, which identifies it by its Latin title (in other words specifies which solid it is and what its characteristics are). Underneath the drawing and watercolour of the solid in question is an inscription with the title in Ancient Greek, the language of the early mathe­maticians and the great philosophers. We begin with the sphere and end with the amazing polyhedron with seventy-two faces, passing through all the possible and imaginable variations on the way.
The final overall effect is of a “gallery” of images, almost un­earthly in their perfection."

This astrolabe, dating from 1500, could determine the position of thirty eight stars."

Traces of a second donor, symmetrical to the first one, emerged at the bottom right during recent restoration work. This detail is confirmed by the scene that appears to the left of the Virgin and Child: through a rocky arch we see an urban landscape in the background and, in front of this, two Christian knights being attacked by a Turk on horseback. The entire painting can thus probably be considered as a sort of votive offering for salvation from an attack: unfortunately, due to the damage caused to the painted surface, the portrait of only one of the two donors has survived."

It is the largest renaissance cartoon that has survived to this day, and was made by Raphael as a preparatory work for the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican, which was commissioned by Julius II. It entered Federico Borromeo’s collection in 1626, when he purchased it from the widow of Fabio Borromeo Visconti for the massive sum of six hundred imperial lire, even though it had actually been on loan to the Ambrosiana since 1610. Although it is known as The School of Athens, the more exact title is Philosophy, as suggested by the allegory of the same subject painted on the vault above the fresco in the Stanza della Segnatura, as part of a very complex iconographic project. At the centre we see the two greatest philosophers, Plato (painted with the likeness of Leonardo, with his finger pointing upwards and identifiable by the Timaeus he is holding, one of his works that had enormous influence on later philosophy) and Aristotle, who is identified by his book of Ethics."
Portrait of a Young Man,Giorgione (Giorgio da Castelfranco copia da) (1478 circa-1510),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Copia-da-Giorgione-Ritratto-di-giovane-854x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_a_Young_Man.jpg,,c. 1510 - 1520,Painting,,23 × 20 cm,Portrait,,4,"In the documents that record the donation of this painting by Cardinal Federico, it is attributed to Andrea del Sarto and is said to show the young Christ or the young Saviour with a ball in his hand. More recently, art historians have tended to see in this painting a good copy from an original by Giorgione that is unfortunately now lost. The sitter would appear to exclude the idea that this is a religious subject, and it has been suggested that it might be the young Paris holding a golden ball, alluding to the famous golden apple of mythology, or quite simply an anonymous page with youthful, almost childish features."

He is sitting on a rocky spur with his sides covered by the shroud in which he had been wrapped, and with his right hand he points to the wound in his ribs. In his left hand he holds the banner of Easter victory (the white flag with a red cross). The rock he is seated on bears, to the left, a Latin inscription which takes from a phrase from the apostle Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, making the words those of our Lord after the resurrection. It acts as a caption for this painting: “Death shall have no dominion over me”."
The Assumption of the Virgin,Giovanni Agostino da Lodi (1467-1524 circa),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giovanni-Agostino-da-Lodi-Assunzione-della-Vergine-537x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Assumption_of_the_Virgin.jpg,,c. 1510 - 1520,Painting,,195 × 100 cm,Sacred art,,9,"This Assumption is a late work by Agostino da Lodi, when the painter was living and working in Milan. The painting was probably the main panel in a polyptych for an altar, of which unfortunately no other elements remain. The pose of the Virgin is curious, and she is shown sitting rather than standing, as was more common in art at the time. It is interesting to note the apostle Thomas, shown standing on Mary’s right, holding a belt: according to one very ancient story, the Virgin returned from heaven to give the incredulous Thomas her own belt as proof of her assumption into heaven."

But I have not been able to discover who painted it, nor how it was that painting on crystal first started”, writes the Cardinal in his Musaeum. We do not know if this painting on glass is the one described by Federico, but we can say that art historians today have identified it as the work of the great Dutch artist Lucas van Leyden. The work shows the young David, accompanied by the chants of women, as he carries the head of Goliath, stuck onto his own enormous sword, in triumph. The story of the duel between David and Goliath appears in the First Book of Samuel (Sam 1:17)."

The construction cannot but recall the beautiful sacristy with paintings by Bergognone in Santa Maria della Passione. If we look carefully at the Virgin’s pedestal, we can see it consists of a monochrome triptych with, from left to right, Adam, the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, and Eve picking the fruit from the tree at the centre of the garden. The choice of subject is not coincidental, for it portrays Mary and Joseph as the new Eve and the new Adam, in accordance with the words of Saint Paul: “For as by the disobedience of one man [Adam], many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one [Jesus], many shall be made just” (Epistle to the Romans, 5:18)."

At the bottom right-hand corner of the panel a date (1511) and an inscription, with the name “Salai”, are clearly visible: this was the nickname given by Leonardo da Vinci to one of his favourite pupils, Gian Giacomo Caprotti, who was often used as a model in his master’s studio. Critics discuss about whether or not this is the artist’s signature on the painting (which would thus be attributed to Caprotti), or if this is a portrait of Salai, who would thus have lent his face as a model for the work. In any case, this panel depicts a religious subject (the face of Christ the Redeemer), as indicated by three iconographic signs which, as though forming a cross, appear behind the head, suggesting a sort of halo of the Trinity."

It shows the Madonna nursing the Child and it has a wealth of symbolic elements. In art history, the wall and the fountain are a reference to the Canticle of Canticles – “My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up” (Ct 4: 12) – and symbolise the fertile virginity of Mary; the steps behind her indicate that, for the believer, the Virgin is the chosen means that leads to Heaven. Also, between the fountain and the wall, we see blue irises, which recall the Marian title of “Queen of Heaven”, and white lilies, which symbolise the “Mother most pure” and the “Mother most chaste”, as referred to in the Loreto Litanies. In the background on the right, there is a building and the figure of Joseph, and on the left, in lush, peaceful vegetation, we see some men and animals, the symbolism of which is however not clear."

On the right wing, even though the absence of any break in continuity of the scene might suggest the presence of Joseph, there is a man in pilgrim’s attire, who is possibly Saint James the Apostle. Scholars still do not entirely agree on the authorship of this work, which is attributed to the so-called “Master of the Holy Blood”, an artist in whom we find the influence of Quentin Massys."

The painting is extremely interesting also in terms of its symbolism: the Madonna enthroned has the Child on her knees, in the act of handing a stylised palm to Saint Ambrose, who is identified by the mitre at his feet and by the scourge resting on the throne. The palm is a reward for his victory over Arianism through his pastoral actions and writings. This is symbolised by the corpse of Arius, shown in a daring foreshortening at the foot of the Milanese prelate. On the right is the Archangel Saint Michael, whose emblems – the scales and the sword – rest one on the throne and the other on the predella, and who is shown handing the animula, the symbol of a dead soul, to the Infant Jesus. The frog lying dead on its back at his feet symbolises malignity defeated."

Originally placed in the church of Santa Maria in Milan, it was carved between 1516 and 1517, but was immediately dismembered: as well as in the Ambrosiana, parts of the monument are now in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan, in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, in the Collezione Borromeo, in the Musée Jacquemart-André in Paris, in the Museo Civico in Turin and in the Prado in Madrid. These two lesenes are a perfect example of the truly superlative art of Bambaia, who managed to create high reliefs with figures and objects brought fully into the round."

Daggers with sheath (eared sfondagiaco dagger),Milanese Gunsmiths,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Due-Pugnali-con-custodia-armorari-milanesi-1024x382.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Daggers_with_sheath_(eared_sfondagiaco_dagger).jpg,,c. 1520,Object,,295 x 36 cm; 169 × 20 cm,,,8,"The sfondagiaco is a rare type of dagger, with a robust blade and a very sharp tip, capable of perforating chainmail and sliding between metal armour plates. The handle of this dagger is elegantly decorated with gilding and diamonds and the ribbon that is wound around the ears bears the second verse of Psalm 31 (30): IN TE DOMIN[E] SPERAVI / ET NON CONFUNDAR IN [AETERNUM] (“In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded”). Tradition has it that this was the weapon used by Andrea Lampugnani to kill Galeazzo Sforza at the doors of the church of Santo Stefano on 26 December 1476, but this is refuted by the date attributed to the dagger by experts."
The Holy Family with Saints Anne and John,Bernardino Luini (1480-1532),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bernardino-Luini-Sacra-Famiglia-con-Sant-Anna-e-San-Giovannino-813x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Holy_Family_with_Saints_Anne_and_John.jpg,,c. 1520 - 1530,Painting,,118 × 92 cm,Sacred art,,1,"This artwork was one of Cardinal Federico’s favourites, and he wanted it to be shown very prominently in the Ambrosiana collection. In his treatise Musaeum published in 1625, a fundamental document for the history of the original collection, Borromeo himself stated that the model for this panel was the cartoon by Leonardo, now in the National Gallery in London, from which Luini possibly made a partial tracing. To the composition made by the Tuscan genius, Luini added the figure of Saint Joseph to the left of the Virgin."
Saint John the Baptist,Gian Giacomo Caprotti,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Gian-Giacomo-Caprotti-detto-Salai-San-Giovanni-Battista-706x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Saint_John_the_Baptist.jpg,,c. 1520,Painting,,73 × 50.9 cm,Sacred art,,Aula Leonardi,"Also this painting has a troubled history of attributions: it was originally considered to be by Bernardino Luini, and then even by Leonardo, before being attributed to Leonardo’s most wayward and daring follower, Gian Giacomo Caprotti, called Salai (or Salaino), a name of Arabic origin which is said to mean “little devil”. Art historians today do not commit themselves, talking generically of a Leonardesque painter in the first quarter of the Cinquecento. The artist undoubtedly took inspiration from the Saint John the Baptist now in the Louvre, which is certainly by Leonardo, but there are some substantial differences: the cross that appears in the original is missing and the figure, which Leonardo sets against a dark background, is shown here with effeminate, almost affected features in an idyllic landscape."
Christ Crowned with Thorns,Bernardino Luini (1480-1532),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bernardino-Luini-Incoronazione-di-spine-affresco-1024x637.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Christ_Crowned_with_Thorns.jpg,,1522,Fresco,,420 × 714 cm,Sacred art,,Aula Leonardi,"The architecture of the Aula Leonardi is dominated by a majestic fresco by one of Leonardo da Vinci’s most mature and original followers, Bernardino Luini. The subject of this mural painting is clearly explained by the cartouche at the top of the central bay, which bears the title of the work itself: Caput regis gloriae spinis coronatur (“The Head of the King of Glory Crowned with Thorns”). The scene is divided into three distinct parts. At the centre, Christ is wearing a scarlet mantle and holding a cane as though it were a sceptre, and he appears to be seated on a sort of throne. His wrists are tied by a rope and on his head he wears a crown of thorns. He is surrounded by several soldiers who insult and mock him with strange grimaces, while two of them, who are closest to him, look as though they intend to beat on the crown of thorns with sticks, to press it deeper into his flesh. The two sides, on the other hand, show the twelve members of the Confraternita di Santa Corona, who commissioned the fresco from Bernardino Luini. There are six on each side, kneeling and wrapped in heavy black cloaks. Before it was taken over by the Ambrosiana, this hall was the chapter house of the confraternity, which was named after the Holy Crown of Christ and devoted to charitable work."
The Adoration with Saint Roch,Gian Pietro Rizzoli detto Giampietrino (1508-1549),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Gian-Pietro-Rizzoli-detto-Giampietrino-Adorazione-del-Bambino-con-San-Rocco-807x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Adoration_with_Saint_Roch.jpg,,c. 1523 - 1524,Painting,,150 × 120 cm,Sacred art,,3,"This Leonardesque panel comes from the church of San Sepolcro, which is now an integral part of the Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana. Putti musicians cheer the Infant Jesus and Saint Roch joins in the adoration of the Child. The saint is identified by his pilgrim staff and cape, by the wound on his leg caused by the plague, and by the dog with the loaf. Since the saint was particularly invoked during times of plague, it might be reasonable to think that the painting is somehow linked to the great epidemic that struck Milan between 1524 and 1529."
The infant Jesus with a Lamb,Bernardino Luini (1480-1532),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bernardino-Luini-Gesu-Bambino-con-l-agnello-900x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_infant_Jesus_with_a_Lamb.jpg,,c. 1525,Painting,,28 × 25 cm,Sacred art,,1,"This delightful panel is certainly striking for its mastery of technique and for its ability to express the tenderness of the Infant Jesus in his delicate embrace of the lamb. From an iconographic point of view, the presence of the lamb may refer to the Passion (Jesus as the Lamb of God, whose immolation on the cross redeems all creation) or to Jesus the Good Shepherd, as described in the tenth chapter of the Gospel of John (“I am the good shepherd”)."
"The Holy Family with Sain John, Tobias and the Archangel Raphael",Bonifacio Veronese (1487-1553),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bonifacio-Veronese-Santa-Famiglia-con-san-Giovanni-Tobia-e-l-arcangelo-Raffaele-1024x805.jpg,"ambrosiana_images/The_Holy_Family_with_Sain_John,_Tobias_and_the_Archangel_Raphael.jpg",,c. 1525 - 1527,Painting,,116 × 152 cm,Sacred art,,1,"Painted between 1525 and 1527, the artwork is striking for the immense gentleness with which Saint Joseph holds the infant Jesus, playind delicately with his foot, and for the tender look of Mary, passing a fruit to her husband, as though wishing to give him sustenance during the flight to Egypt. In the scene we see the young Saint John the Baptist, who is identified by his camel skin, together with the Archangel Raphael and Tobias, who is identified by the fish, from which he extracted the gall to cure his father’s blindness, as told in the Book of Tobit."
Portrait of Bernardino da Lesmo,Bartolomeo Veneto (1502-1530),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bartolomeo-Veneto-Ritratto-di-Bernardino-da-Lesmo-686x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Bernardino_da_Lesmo.jpg,,c. 1529,Painting,,90 × 60 cm,Portrait,,12,"Formerly attributed to none other than Leonardo, this painting should in fact be considered as one of the finest portraits by Bartolomeo Veneto: as we see in the folded scroll in the sitter’s hand, this is Bernardino da Lesmo, master of the house to Count Girolamo Moroni. The painting is noteworthy for its attention to detail: the white shirt, the lace protruding from the sleeves, the three rings on the left hand, the right hand resting on the hilt of a dagger, and the sumptuous drapery that forms the backdrop."
The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist,Ubertini Francesco detto Bachiacca (1494-1557),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Ubertini-Francesco-detto-Bachiacca-Sacra-Famiglia-con-San-Giovannino-744x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Holy_Family_with_Saint_John_the_Baptist.jpg,,c. 1530 - 1540,Painting,,122 × 90 cm,Sacred art,,10,"Bachiacca was a Florentine Mannerist painter who probably trained in the school of Perugino. This panel, which shows the influence of Leonardo, Andrea del Sarto and Fra Bartolomeo, contains a wealth of botanical symbolism: the Baby Jesus shows John the Baptist a pomegranate, a sign of his future Passion; the Precursor’s cross lies between two columbine flowers, indicating his future martyrdom; on the right of the Virgin we see her attribute, dog roses, and behind Joseph a thriving pomegranate tree announces the future flourishing of the Church; lastly the little wild strawberry flowers recall the mystery of the Incarnation."
The Madonna and Child with Saint Peter and Saint Jerome,Cesare Magni (1511-1534),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Cesare-Magni-Madonna-con-il-Bambino-tra-San-Pietro-e-San-Girolamo-771x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Madonna_and_Child_with_Saint_Peter_and_Saint_Jerome.jpg,,1530,Painting,,145 × 110 cm,Sacred art,,3,"Elements of Leonardo combine in this lovely panel with classical forms inspired by Raphael. The Madonna is shown holding the Child in the company of Saint Peter and Saint Jerome. The former is identified by the keys in his right hand (“And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven”, Jesus said to him, as we read in the Gospel of Matthew, 1:19), while the latter is shown dressed as a cardinal, in a very ancient and frequent iconographic form."
Man in Armour,Tiziano Vecellio (1480-1576),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Tiziano-Vecellio-Uomo-in-Armatura-920x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Man_in_Armour.jpg,,c. 1530,Painting,,65 × 58cm,Portrait,,1,"In his Musaeum Federico Borromeo writes that “Titian would have wanted to paint his father like this, armour-clad, to celebrate in a playful manner the nobility he claimed to have acquired though such offspring”. This would therefore make the portrait that of Gregorio Vecellio, Captain of the Centuria of Pieve di Cadore and the painter’s father."
The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian,Antonio Badile (1518-1560),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Antonio-Badile-Martirio-di-San-Sebastiano-689x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Martyrdom_of_Saint_Sebastian.jpg,,c. 1530 - 1540,Painting,,150 × 101 cm,Sacred art,,10,"This large altarpiece shows Saint Sebastian in the foreground, tied to a column and calmly enduring the torment of the arrows, while an angel on the left brings him the crown of martyrdom. What makes the painting so interesting is the antiquarian taste that permeates the composition and shows us with great topographical accuracy the main buildings of Imperial Rome."
The Martyrdom of Saint Peter of Verona,Alessandro Bonvicino detto Moretto (1490-1554),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Alessandro-Bonvicino-detto-Moretto-Martirio-di-San-Pietro-da-Verona-534x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Martyrdom_of_Saint_Peter_of_Verona.jpg,,c. 1533 - 1534,Painting,,310 × 163 cm,Sacred art,,12,"A Dominican friar of the convent of Sant’Eustorgio in Milan, Peter of Verona was an Inquisitor and preacher against the heresy of the Cathars: in 1252, together with a confrère, he was killed by a heretic in the woods between Seveso and Barlassina, struck on the head by a great cleaver. Moretto’s painting shows the scene of his martyrdom: the Saint, in the foreground, already struck on the head, is writing the word credo with his own blood on the ground, while in the middle ground his co-brother attempts to escape the assassin’s attack. In the upper part of the altarpiece, three angels hold a number of iconographic symbols that refer to the Saint: the palm and crown to indicate the victory of martyrdom, and the lily, which alludes to the virtue of chastity."
The Annunciation,Gerolamo Mazzola Bedoli (1500-1569),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Gerolamo-Mazzola-Bedoli-Annunciazione-695x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Annunciation.jpg,,c. 1538 - 1540,Painting,,208 × 144 cm,Sacred art,,10,"This panel, with Mannerist characteristics that are so evident that it was long attributed to Parmigianino, has a wealth of symbolic references and classical elements. The scene is set in front of a vaguely classical temple, indicating that the Virgin has believed in the angelic annunciation and has thus become the temple of the Word and the new Ark of the Covenant. Also the figure of the archangel Gabriel has a classical look, almost as though he were Mercury, the messenger of the gods. An open book on Mary’s kneeler – a book of hours, it seems, for it contains rubrics to indicate the correct order of the prayers –  bears two biblical quotations (Is 7:14 and Mc 1:34;38) referring to the mystery of the Incarnation."
Mary Magdalene,Tiziano Vecellio (1480-1576),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Tiziano-Vecellio-La-Maddalena-829x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Mary_Magdalene.jpg,,c. 1540,Painting,,96 × 74 cm,Sacred art,,1,"The figure of Saint Mary Magdalene was very dear to the Cardinal as an image of sincere penitence and true love of Christ. According to the classic tradition, a good rendering of Mary Magdalene was to contain three elements: the aesthetic, in the form of female beauty, the penitential, generally with a stark landscape, and the ecstatic. This painting, which is derived from the Mary Magdalene of the Palatine Gallery in Florence, is praised in the Musaeum for “the artist’s skill in maintaining proper modesty in such nudity”, and indeed the viewer’s eye is immediately attracted by the saint’s face enraptured in ecstasy. Recent cleaning of the canvas has more clearly revealed, to the left of Mary Magdalene, the jar of ointment, her iconographic emblem. More importantly, it has also uncovered the artist’s signature (Titianus fecit – “Titian made [it]”)."
Portrait of a Pilgrim,Monogrammista HL (XVI secolo),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Monogrammista-HL-Ritratto-di-pellegrino-754x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_a_Pilgrim.jpg,,1542,Painting,,60 × 44 cm,Portrait,,21,"This austere, intense portrait is the work of Monogrammist HL, whose monogram HLF appears on one of the shells. The sitter, who has a rosary around his right wrist, bears the shells very conspicuously on his shoulder and chest, indicating his status as a pilgrim. Initially considered to be a portrait of Saint Ignatius Loyola, scholars today prefer not to identify the sitter. On the back of the panel there is a date (1542) and an inscription stating that it had belonged to don Federico Crivelli, who died on 30 April 1589, and that it “it was given to me, Battista Rubenino, priest, by his agents”: “Era del s. don Federico Crivelli qual morite a li 30 aprile 1589 e i soi agenti l’ano donato a me prete Battista Rubenino”."
The Adoration of the Magi,Andrea Schiavone (1510-1563),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Andrea-Schiavone-Adorazione-dei-Magi-1024x851.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Adoration_of_the_Magi.jpg,,c. 1547,Painting,,185 × 222 cm,Sacred art,,1,"Andrea Schiavone (schiavone means “Slav”, indicating the painter’s origins) was a leading exponent of Mannerism in Veneto, and this Adoration of the Magi is an excellent example of Mannerist painting, which appears in the repeated presence of the figura serpentinata – figures in a spiral pose. The work dates from about the mid-fifteenth century and is striking for its dynamism and for the style which recalls that of Parmigianino, from whom Schiavone took inspiration."
The Rest on the Flight into Egypt,Jacopo da Ponte detto il Bassano (1510-1592),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jacopo-da-Ponte-detto-il-Bassano-Riposo-durante-la-fuga-in-Egitto-2-1024x780.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Rest_on_the_Flight_into_Egypt.jpg,,1547,Painting,,118 × 158 cm,Sacred art,,4,"This painting was particularly admired by Cardinal Federico as one of the finest works by Jacopo Bassano. Probably made in late 1547, it takes up a very popular theme in religious painting – the Holy Family resting on their flight into Egypt – but it shows it in a new and original manner. The scene focuses on Mary, who is seen holding the Child in her arms. Joseph lovingly contemplates him, while all around there are numerous realistic details (such as the swaddling bands in the foreground) and other figures (such as the two youths who appear to be restraining the donkey, and the shepherd kneeling on the left). The scene is complex and brought to life by great physical and psychological dynamism."
Male portrait,Hans Muelich (1516-1573),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Hans-Muelich-Ritratto-maschile-691x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Male_portrait.jpg,,1548,Painting,,71 × 51 cm,Portrait,,21,"In this panel we see the portrait of an elegantly dressed man holding a crystal glass in his right hand, between his thumb and forefinger. A scroll hanging from a tree to his left tells us the date the painting was made (1548) and the age of the gentlemen (42). The work has a wealth of details, both in the clothes and in the rendering of the landscape. Indicated as the work of Hans Holbein in the donation documents, some scholars later attributed it to Hans Muelich, but now even this attribution has been brought into question and some prefer to talk more generically of a “German painter”."
Ceremonial saddle and stirrups. Detail of the wooden horse of Troy,Arte armaiola milanese,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Sella-da-parata-e-staffe-Particolare-del-Cavallo-di-Troia-1024x585.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Ceremonial_saddle_and_stirrups._Detail_of_the_wooden_horse_of_Troy.jpg,,c. 1550 - 1575,Object,,,,,8,"This sumptuous ceremonial saddle, complete with its two stirrups, bears chased images of the first and last episodes of the war of Troy: the rape of Helen and the famous wooden horse of Troy, with the burning of the city. The two stirrups are also decorated with male and female figures. These artefacts are examples of the art of armoury for high-ranking patrons as it developed in Milan during the second half of the sixteenth century."
Portrait of a Gentleman (Michel de l’Hospital),Giovan Battista Moroni (1520-1578),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giovan-Battista-Moroni-Ritratto-di-Michel-de-lHospital-607x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_a_Gentleman_(Michel_de_l’Hospital).jpg,,1554,Painting,,185 × 115 cm,Portrait,,12,"In Roman numerals on the fragment of stone at the bottom right we see the date when Giovan Battista Moroni finished this portrait: 1554. It shows a gentleman, full-length, leaning on the plinth of a column, on which we see a Latin phrase taken from Horace: Impavidum ferient ruinae (“Ruins would strike him undismayed”). This motto has made it possible to make a hypothesis about the identity of the sitter: it might be Michel de l’Hospital, the representative of the King of France at the Tridentine Council (1547-1548), who did indeed use this phrase from Horace as his own personal motto, even though it was fairly common in sixteenth-century France. The painting is remarkable for its attention to detail, from the sitter’s garments through to the subtle play of shadows."
Adoration of the Magi,Tiziano Vecellio (1480-1576),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Tiziano-Vecellio-Adorazione-dei-Magi-1-1024x603.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Adoration_of_the_Magi.jpg,,c. 1557 - 1560,Painting,,223 × 120 cm,Sacred art,,1,"Painted around 1559-60, the painting has much in common with Titian’s mature works. The rendering of the sky is interesting, for the colour is applied in such a way as to leave some areas of raw canvas, creating a very singular effect. There is a curious anecdote about thisa painting: the pretty little dog at the base of the hut was painted over, because it was considered scandalous and irreverent. In his De pictura sacra, Federico Borromeo, founder of the Ambrosiana, refers to the person who had it covered as “stern and fanatical” and he quotes Titian himself when he said “it was not surprising the persons ignorant of any art should commit such a disfigurement”. During the latest restoration, the little animal was returned to view, further revealing the brilliant Venetian painter’s interest in nature."

It came to the Ambrosiana with the Bartolomeo Calchi Donation and was immediately put on display next to the copy of Michelangelo’s Pietà. The right arm, which is extended rather than bent, shows that this cast was made after the 1532-1533 restoration of the original."

Leoni’s collection later became the property of Bartolomeo Calchi, who – as the Latin inscription on the base recalls – donated this copy of Michelangelo’s masterpiece to the Ambrosiana. It is important to note that this copy shows us the state the original was in prior to the 1736 restoration of the Virgin’s left hand and of Christ’s right hand."
The Placing of Christ in the Sepulchre,Tiziano Vecellio (1480-1576),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bottega-di-Tiziano-Vecellio-Deposizione-di-Cristo-nel-sepolcro-1024x892.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Placing_of_Christ_in_the_Sepulchre.jpg,,c. 1570 - 1573,Painting,,108 × 208,Sacred art,,1,"This painting brings about an authentic whirl of emotions: with great devotion Nicodemus, the Pharisee who went to Jesus at night, and Joseph of Arimathea lay the body of Chris; the Mother impresses a kiss upon her son’s lifeless body; Mary Magdalene “expresses excruciating pain deep within” and John, the favourite disciple, “appears to compete in affection with Mary Magdalene”. The shadows cast upon the scene appear to evoke the great darkness that covered the land when Jesus died on the cross. The artist’s signature, TITIANUS P. (Titianus pinxit – “Titian painted this”), appears at the base of the tomb, even though the painting contains studio work and the critics suggest it was finished by Palma the Younger."

The work came to the Ambrosiana only in the early twentieth century and we do not know who commissioned it. It should however be recalled that Giulio Cesare Procaccini played a very important role in the artistic reform promoted by Federico Borromeo, who entrusted him with some important works, including some of the quadroni of the cycle of miracles of Saint Charles Borromeo made for the Duomo. Even though this painting is small and possibly a study for an altarpiece, it clearly reveals the talent and inventiveness of this brilliant artist."

The emphasis here is not so much on the religious aspect of Morigia as on him as an erudite historian and it is worth noting that he is holding a pair of glasses in his right hand. The meticulously naturalistic rendering of the objects reminds us that Fede Galizia was also a painter of still lifes. The paper the friar is writing on bears verses by Borgogni, which refer to the painting and to the artist’s painting skills."
Landscape with Saint John the Baptist,Paul Bril (1554-1626),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Paul-Bril-Paesaggio-con-San-Giovannino-1024x744.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Landscape_with_Saint_John_the_Baptist.jpg,,c. 1595,Painting,,83 × 131 cm,"Landscape,Sacred art",,7,"Here we see the young Saint John the Baptist in a charming, typically Flemish painting. The saint is identified by his attributes – the cross, the lamb, and the austere woollen tunic. The lonely place where the Precursor has retired to is not a parched desert but rather a luxuriant forest inhabited by delightful animals, enlivened by the songs of countless birds and swarming with insects and even pretty little snails. Here too the representation of an important biblical figure becomes an opportunity to create a genre picture."
Basket of fruit,Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Canestra-di-frutta-Michelangelo-Merisi-da-Caravaggio-1024x786.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Basket_of_fruit.jpg,,c. 1597 - 1600,Painting,,"54,5 × 67,5 cm",Still life,,1,"This is probably the most famous painting in the collection of Cardinal Federico Borromeo, which formed the original nucleus of the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. It is considered to be a sort of prototype of the “still life” genre. It shows a wicker basket brimming with fruit and leaves, rendered with great realism and attention to detail. This almost conflicts with the abstract neutral background of the painting and with the line of colour the basket itself is resting on, and from which it juts out. The founder of the Ambrosiana mentions this extraordinary painting many times in his writings and says he has searched in vain for a work that can bear comparison to it. But, he writes “for its incomparable beauty and excellence, it remained alone”. The painting has been interpreted in many different ways, some of which are religious: the extreme realism with which the fresh fruits are placed alongside those that are worm-eaten, and the leaves that gradually dry out and shrivel, give tangible form to the inexorable passing of time."
Crib,Federico Barocci o Baroccio detto il Fiori (1535-1612) (replica di),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Barocci-Presepe-Nativita-3-823x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Crib.jpg,,c. 1599,Painting,,135.4 × 110 cm,Sacred art,,6,"Federico Borromeo considered this beautiful painting as “one of the dearest things I possess”. It has been suggested that he kept it in his study in the archbishop’s palace, and indeed it entered the Ambrosiana collection only after his death. There have been long discussions about the authorship of the work, but it has recently been affirmed that “the definition of autograph replica for the Milan specimen is the most appropriate”. An identical painting, probably the original version seen by Federico Borromeo, is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and it was donated in 1605 to Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain, by Francesco Maria Della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. It is interesting to note how there is a total lack of any natural or artificial source of light, since the entire scene is flooded with divine light that radiates from the face of the Infant Jesus, just as we are told in one of the apocryphal gospels."

It was made in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century and reflects the devotional zeal which sprang up around the great Archbishop of Milan, and which culminated in his canonisation in 1610. Federico Borromeo referred to this portrait as the best that had ever been painted of Saint Charles."

Original Sin,Jan II Brueghel il Giovane (1601-1678),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jan-II-Brueghel-il-Giovane-Peccato-originale-1024x598.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Original_Sin.jpg,,c. 1640,Painting,,49 × 83 cm,Sacred art,,21,"Probably dating from about 1640, these two panels were painted by Jan Brueghel the Younger, the son of Jan Brueghel the Elder. The fact that they are exactly the same size suggests that they were part of a single work, together with other paintings, all based on the first chapters of the Book of Genesis. In terms of subject and composition, the general format is clearly derived from his father’s works, even though the quality is considerably lower, as can be seen, for example, in the ungainly, impossible position of Eve in the scene of the original sin."
Mouse with Roses,Jan Brueghel il Vecchio “Dei Velluti” (1568-1625),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jan-Brueghel-il-Vecchio-Dei-Velluti-Topolino-con-rose-1024x713.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Mouse_with_Roses.jpg,,c. 1605 - 1611,Painting,,7.2 × 10.2 cm,Miniature,,7,"In the Musaeum we read: “I note that Brueghel painted on parchment a mouse with some stems of roses and insects. I wanted to call particular attention to this parchment and make it known that its value can rest on the fact that even mice in it are enjoyable to look at” In actual fact, this miniature masterpiece is not on parchment but on copper, and it is most likely the “trifle, of little import” which Brueghel mentions in a letter to the Cardinal in 1605."

The mark on the base of the cup is that of Christoph Lencker, who worked in Augsburg in the late-sixteenth/early-seventeenth century."
Allegory of Fire,Jan Brueghel il Vecchio “Dei Velluti” (1568-1625),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jan-Brueghel-il-Vecchio-Dei-Velluti-Allegoria-del-fuoco-olio-su-rame-1024x698.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Allegory_of_Fire.jpg,,1608,Painting,,46 × 66 cm,Allegory,,7,"This is undoubtedly the most striking of the four paintings, and the one in which the artist’s imagination has run most freely, adopting an almost infinite number of creative solutions. The element fire appears primarily in the enormous blaze that, as an untameable force of nature, is devouring the building on the mountain in the middle distance. But the artist has also worked on the theme of fire through the representation of an enormous workshop, where the workers (whom the Cardinal refers to as the mythical Cyclops) are at work producing an enormous number of objects: armours, glassware, pitchers, domestic implements, and tools for a crafts workshop. The power of fire is needed to produce this huge number of objects, no longer as an overwhelming, destructive force, but tamed by man and subjected to his will in the furnace which we see on the left-hand side. The painting is signed and dated 1608, and was the first of the four to be made."
Flowers in a Vase,Jan Brueghel il Vecchio “Dei Velluti” (1568-1625),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jan-Brueghel-Fiori-in-un-vaso-689x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Flowers_in_a_Vase.jpg,,1608,Painting,,43 × 30 cm,Still life,,7,"A colourful bunch of flowers with tulips appears in a römer, a characteristic Rhenish glass that often appears in northern paintings of this period. In a letter of 13 June 1608 Brueghel says he is sending a painting of three tulips and other rare spring flowers. As well as establishing the origin of the painting, it also recalls an important characteristic of Flemish painters, which is that they liked to paint from life. In another letter, dated 26 September of the same year, he says he has most diligently made another little painting from life with tulips picked in May. This is the second documented painting of this genre, after the Vase of Flowers with Jewel, Coins and Shells (inv. 66), also in the Cardinal’s collection."

It consists of about a hundred different species of flowers, some of which are very rare and of great quality. In a letter we read that Brueghel was working on it in 1606 and that he had seen these flowers in the garden of Archduke Alberto and Archduchess Isabella in Brussels, and that he had wanted to ritrare dal natural. In his Musaeum, Borromeo has this to say about the work: “Brueghel painted a diamond on the lower part of the vase…: he wished to show that the value of his work was equal to that of the jewel and this is the price that we paid to the artist.”"
The Adoration of the Magi,Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli also known as Morazzone (1571-1626),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Pier-Francesco-Mazzucchelli-detto-il-Morazzone-Adorazione-dei-Magi-1-682x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Adoration_of_the_Magi.jpg,,c. 1610,Painting,,42 × 29 cm,Sacred art,,14,"This painting with The Adoration of the Magi is small but extremely delicate, as we see in the pose of the Virgin and in the elegant gesture of the servant who is shown kneeling down to give one of the Magi a gift to be offered to the Infant Jesus. The work was purchased at the beginning of the century but scholars still have not reached an agreement on the date of execution."
Diana the Huntress,Joachim Friess (XVI-XVII secolo),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Joachim-Friess-Trofeo-o-gioco-motorio-con-Diana-cacciatrice-1-746x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Diana_the_Huntress.jpg,,c. 1610 - 1620,Object,,39 cm,,,8,"This table trophy is fitted with a mechanism that makes it turn around on itself. It portrays the goddess Diana riding a stag and holding two dogs on leashes. On the base we find another two hunters, dogs, hares, reptiles and beetles, not to scale. This very unusual object was used to delight guests during dinner, and it bears the initials of the artist who made it (J.F.). It testifies to the high quality of jewellery in the city of Augsburg, where it was made, in the early seventeenth century."
Seascape,Paul Bril (1554-1626),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Paul-Bril-Veduta-marina-1024x723.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Seascape.jpg,,1611,Painting,,104 × 148 cm,Landscape,,7,"In his Musaeum, Cardinal Borromeo writes about this painting: “The sea appears in a view so serene, tranquil and extensive that anyone who turns his eyes in that direction might believe that he is pacing those marine distances with both eye and foot.” In the deed of donation of 1618 he also states that this view “is one of the most beautiful things upon which I have ever set my eyes”, and it appears that he really considered it to be the finest work by Bril in his collection."
The Last Supper,Andrea Bianchi detto il Vespino (attivo 1612-1640),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Andrea-Bianchi-detto-il-Vespino-Ultima-Cena-1024x146.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Last_Supper.jpg,,c. 1611 - 1616,Painting,,118 × 835 cm,Sacred art,,Aula Leonardi,"Andrea Bianchi, known as “Vespino”, was a professional painter who worked in Milan in the late Cinquecento and in the first three decades of the Seicento. He was the favourite artist of Cardinal Federico Borromeo, who commissioned him to make a number of copies of great Renaissance masterpieces, and of works by Leonardo da Vinci in particular. This was so that a reliable record would remain, especially when there were fears that the original might one day be lost. The best example of this is the copy of The Last Supper, on which Vespino worked from 1611 to 1616."
The Virgin of the Rocks,Andrea Bianchi detto il Vespino (attivo 1612-1640),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Andrea-Bianchi-detto-il-Vespino-Vergine-delle-rocce-626x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Virgin_of_the_Rocks.jpg,,c. 1611 - 1618,Painting,,193 × 119 cm,Sacred art,,Aula Leonardi,"Andrea Bianchi, known as “Vespino”, was a professional painter who worked in Milan in the late Cinquecento and in the first three decades of the Seicento. He was the favourite artist of Cardinal Federico Borromeo, who commissioned him to make a number of copies of great Renaissance masterpieces, and of works by Leonardo da Vinci in particular. The Virgin of the Rocks is extremely faithful to the version now in London, and which at the time still adorned the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the convent of San Francesco Grande, close to the basilica of Sant’Ambrogio. Actually, Vespino’s copy shows us what the London version originally looked like, in which the three figures (the Christ Child, St John the Baptist, and the Virgin) have haloes, and the little St John is holding a cross. Art historians have in fact established that the halos and the cross were added for devotional reasons at a later date, after the early decades of the seventeenth century, and that they did not appear in the original. So here too we can see that the value and the documentary purpose of these works, which were made as part of the Ambrosiana’s artistic and cultural programme, were far from being mundane plagiaries and still today they allow us to reconstruct the history of the great masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance."
The Holy Family,Carlo Francesco Nuvolone (1609-1661),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Carlo-Francesco-Nuvolone-Sacra-Famiglia-728x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Holy_Family.jpg,,c. 1640 - 1650,Painting,,134 × 97 cm,Sacred art,,16,"Formerly attributed to the more famous Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, this painting is now acknowledged as the work of his brother Giuseppe. It was donated to the church of San Sepolcro by Cardinal Alfonso Litta, Archbishop of Milan from 1652 to 1679, before entering the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. The Madonna, with the Child in her lap, stands out in the foreground, partly through the use of brilliant colours, while the ageing Saint Joseph, in softer tones, pensively contemplates the scene from behind."
Allegory of Water,Jan Brueghel il Vecchio “Dei Velluti” (1568-1625),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jan-Brueghel-il-Vecchio-Dei-Velluti-Allegoria-dell-acqua-1024x694.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Allegory_of_Water.jpg,,1614,Painting,,46 × 66 cm,Allegory,,7,"Between 1608 and 1621, Brueghel was commissioned by Federico Borromeo to make four paintings on copper. The history of these Allegories of the Four Elements can be fully retraced in an abundant set of documents now in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. Earth, water, air and fire are the four elements that, from the time of Empedocles’ writings, were long considered to be at the base of all created matter. In Borromeo’s philosophical-theological view, these paintings went well beyond their secular significance and acquired a profound religious value, since Nature was the book written by God, so that man could rise up from Creation to its Creator. Unfortunately, only two of the four works – the Allegory of Fire and the Allegory of Water – are now in the Ambrosiana, because much of the Pinacoteca’s assets were taken to France after being plundered under Napoleon. The Allegory of Earth and the Allegory of Air are now in the Louvre, from which they have never been returned, in spite of the 1815 agreements.
The painting is remarkable for the richness of its natural landscape, it was sent by Brueghel to Cardinal Federico in 1614 and was the third in the series."
The Magdalen and the Angel,Giulio Cesare Procaccini (1574-1625),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giulio-Cesare-Procaccini-La-Maddalena-665x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Magdalen_and_the_Angel.jpg,,c. 1618 - 1620,Painting,,69.5 × 47 cm,Sacred art,,16,"Here Mary Magdalene is shown as “penitent”, with her hand resting on a skull and her eyes raised to the sky, as though enraptured in contemplation.

Settala, the son of the famous head physician of Manzonian fame, is shown here at a young age. He is holding a curious ivory object which has been turned on a lathe. It was quite probably he himself who made it, for not only did he collect naturalistic items of all kinds for his museum, but he also expanded his collection with various curios and scientific instruments that he himself designed and made."
Jael and Sisera,Giuseppe Vermiglio (1585-1635),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giuseppe-Vermiglio-Giaele-e-Sisara-806x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Jael_and_Sisera.jpg,,c. 1621,Painting,,130 × 103 cm,Grand genre,,15,"This work shows us the “mannish Jael” (maschia Giaele) as Manzoni referred to her, just as she breaks Sisera’s skull with the tent nail, as we read in the Book of Judges. We know nothing of the provenance of this painting, nor are there any documents that tell us when it came to the Ambrosiana. The work has been attributed to Giuseppe Vermiglio; it contains some Caravaggesque elements and appears to have been inspired by the same subject painted by Artemisia Gentileschi and now in Budapest."
Judith and Holofernes,Giuseppe Vermiglio (1585-1635),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giuseppe-Vermiglio-Giuditta-e-Oloferne-761x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Judith_and_Holofernes.jpg,,c. 1625,Painting,,136 × 103 cm,Grand genre,,14,"Also in the case of this work by Giuseppe Vermiglio, we have no information about its provenance or about its arrival at the Pinacoteca. The painting shows Judith, who has just cut off the head of the Assyrian general Holofernes and is just about to put it into the sack held by her maid, as we are told in the Book of Judith. The painting, which was probably made in the 1620s, is very elegant, especially in the figure of the Israelite heroine. It is clearly derived from the style of Caravaggio, with the influence of Artemisia Gentileschi."
Allegorical Female Figure,Giovanni Serodine (1600-1631),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giovanni-Serodine-Figura-femminile-allegorica-1024x725.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Allegorical_Female_Figure.jpg,,c. 1626,Painting,,89 × 124 cm,Allegory,,16,"This painting is open to various interpretations, partly due to the symbolism of the many objects that fill the scene and that surround this enigmatic female figure who is shown pressing against her breast. It has been suggested, for example, that this is an allegory of Melancholy, or of Science. However, it is probably Philosophy nourishing and feeding the various liberal arts: the armillary sphere alludes to astronomy, the lute to music, the pair of compasses and the plumb-rule to geometry, mathematics and architecture, and the open books refer to the sciences in general. Lastly, we can see how the woman is holding the rod of authority and indeed Philosophy not only nourishes the arts (the pressed breast), but is also their apex and queen (the sceptre)."

His follower in this genre of painting was his nephew Barent, who skilfully imitated his style, and indeed in the case of some works, like this one, it is hard to say which of the two was the artist. The scene contains a whole variety of figures, some of which are made with great naturalism, as we can see in the skater with his hands behind his back, or in the man playing with a spinning top."
Still Life with Fruit,Isaac Soreau (1604-1638),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Isaac-Soreau-Natura-Morta-con-Frutti-1024x772.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Still_Life_with_Fruit.jpg,,c. 1638,Painting,,38 × 46 cm,Still life,,13,"Even though slightly different in size, the two works appear to have been planned together, and together they reached the Ambrosiana in 1893. The horizontal arrangement of the objects is almost identical: two pewter trays with beautiful fruit are accompanied by fruit, flowers and insects on the table top, which is painted with such precision as to render even the veining of the wood. The simple composition, together with the meticulous execution, help create a sense of abstraction and silence. The römer glass is a typically Flemish detail, which often appears in still lifes from the region."

The Bologna-born artist made many paintings of Mary Magdalene, but this one differs from the others in its more monumental composition and in the unusual pose of the penitent saint, who appears among the rocks with a skull in her hand, enthralled as she looks at an angel pointing to the sky. Even though of great impact, the work is unfinished."
Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden,Jan II Brueghel il Giovane (1601-1678),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Jan-II-Brueghel-il-Giovane-Cacciata-dal-Paradiso-terrestre-1024x594.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Adam_and_Eve_in_the_Garden_of_Eden.jpg,,c. 1640,Painting,,49 × 83 cm,Sacred art,,21,"Probably dating from about 1640, these two panels were painted by Jan Brueghel the Younger, the son of Jan Brueghel the Elder. The fact that they are exactly the same size suggests that they were part of a single work, together with other paintings, all based on the first chapters of the Book of Genesis."
The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis,Ambito di Francesco Albani (1578-1660),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Ambito-di-Francesco-Albani-Trionfo-di-Galatea-2-1024x696.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Wedding_of_Peleus_and_Thetis.jpg,,c. 1650,Painting,,95 × 140 cm,Grand genre,,14,"This painting has been interpreted in a number of ways, but scholars currently agree that it shows the wedding of Peleus, of Greek mythology, and the sea-nymph Thetis: from their marriage came the celebrated Greek hero Achilles. The scene shows the moment when the nymph is led, by a putto holding the nuptial flame, to Peleus. He greets her and takes her to the bridal bed, shown on the right, where other winged putti pull back the curtains. At the bottom left, there is another mythological figure, probably a nymph, blindfolded."
Mercury and Argus,Anonimo genovese (XVII secolo),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Anonimo-genovese-Mercurio-e-Argo-752x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Mercury_and_Argus.jpg,,c. 1650 - 1660,Painting,,96 × 71 cm,Mythological scene,,13,"The painting illustrates an episode from Ovid’s Metamorphoses: Mercury prepares to send Argus to sleep, with the alluring melodies of his flute, and then to kill him at Jove’s command. Argus, the shepherd with a hundred eyes and immense strength, was entrusted by Juno to keep watch over the young Io, who was loved by Jove and transformed by him into a heifer. The painting entered the Ambrosiana collection as a work by the Neapolitan artist Salvator Rosa, but is now attributed to a late-seventeenth-century Genoese painter."
Susanna at her Bath,Carlo Francesco Nuvolone (1609-1661),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Carlo-Francesco-Nuvolone-Susanna-al-bagno-1024x854.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Susanna_at_her_Bath.jpg,,c. 1659,Painting,,155 × 178 cm,Sacred art,,16,"In Chapter 13 of the book of the prophet Daniel, we find the story of Susanna, the lovely, honest woman who, as she takes her bath, is spied upon by two elders who lust after her. The object of wicked blackmail, unjustly accused and condemned to death, Susanna is miraculously freed by the prophet Daniel. The painting shows the moment when Susanna is surprised by the two wicked judges: the younger one, in the background, motions to the woman to keep quiet, while the older one shows her a medallion, as though trying to bribe her."
Still Life with Musical Instruments,Evaristo Baschenis (1617-1677),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Evaristo-Baschenis-Natura-morta-con-strumenti-musicali-1024x659.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Still_Life_with_Musical_Instruments.jpg,,c. 1660 - 1670,Painting,,82 × 127 cm,Still life,,Atrio di passaggio 2 piano,"In this painting, a sumptuously elegant drape is lifted to reveal a still life with musical instruments, with many symbolic meanings: on a table covered with a red cloth, the pattern of which is beautifully rendered, there is a spinet, on which an archlute and a musical score have been placed. In the middle ground, we see a violin with its bow and an apple, which creates a particular note of colour, and a mandora can be seen on the right. Scholars have pointed out how the instruments used are those required to perform a sonata for soloist and thorough-bass. It is also worth noting Baschenis’s technical skill in rendering the thin layer of dust on the mandora on the right. Dust shows that the instruments have not been used, suggesting the absence of music. The work thus acquires the significance of a vanitas, a reminder of the transience of life, and the silent instruments allude to the fleeting experience of our senses."
The Presentation of Christ in the Temple,Pietro Antonio Magatti (1691-1767),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Pietro-Antonio-Magatti-Presentazione-di-Gesu-al-Tempio-881x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Presentation_of_Christ_in_the_Temple.jpg,,c. 1725 - 1730,Painting,,72 × 93 cm,Sacred art,,17,"This painting, with its very balanced composition and extremely delicate tones, shows the presentation of Jesus in the Temple, just as Simeon takes the Child into his arms. Its formal characteristics show that it must have been painted in the 1720s. Scholars are undecided on whether this is a preparatory study or a work that is small in size to make it suitable for private devotion."
Portrait of a Young Man,Vittore Ghislandi detto Frà Galgario (1655-1743),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Vittore-Ghislandi-detto-Fra-Galgario-Ritratto-di-giovane-784x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_a_Young_Man.jpg,,c. 1730 - 1743,Painting,,49 × 39 cm,Portrait,,17,"Of unknown provenance, the painting shows us the portrait of a young man whose body is shown in profile, while the face is shown in three-quarters view. His wavy hair and not particularly immaculate clothes give this work a very natural, informal look. Art historians date it to the last decade of the artist’s work, due to “the blurred, rather ill-defined brushstroke… and the simplicity and immediacy with which the sitter is rendered”."
Moses and the Brazen Serpent,Cesare Ligari (1716-1770),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Cesare-Ligari-Mose-e-il-serpente-di-bronzo-1024x793.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Moses_and_the_Brazen_Serpent.jpg,,1740,Painting,,126 × 163 cm,Sacred art,,17,"On the back of the canvas we read that “Cesare Ligari son of Pietro painted this, in Venice, 1740”. The work was donated to the Ambrosiana by a descendant of theirs, Angelo Ligari. The painting shows the episode described in the Book of Numbers (Nm 21: 4-9): God sent poisonous serpents to punish the Israelites for their lamentations and, when Moses begged him to put an end to the massacre, the Lord ordered that a copper serpent should be raised up on a stake: all those who were bitten by a serpent would be saved if they looked at the effigy."
Kids and Lambs,Francesco Londonio (1723-1783),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Francesco-Londonio-Caprette-e-agnelli-1-1024x756.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Kids_and_Lambs.jpg,,c. 1750 - 1770,Painting,,30 × 40 cm,Petit genre,,17,"Born in the parish of Sant’Alessandro in Milan, Francesco Londonio specialised in genre painting and was also appointed by Maria Theresa of Austria as draughtsman and stage designer for the La Scala opera house. These paintings, studies and finished works are just eight of the thirty-five in the Ambrosiana collection. The subjects are all rustic in nature, probably in part because they were commissioned by landowners, and include studies of kids and lambs, cows’ heads and still lifes with vegetables, creating tranquil and possibly rather idealised scenes of the everyday life of peasants and shepherds. The subjects and techniques place this painter in the transitional period between Arcadia and the Enlightenment."
The Presentation of Christ in the Temple,Giandomenico Tiepolo (1727-1804),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giandomenico-Tiepolo-Presentazione-di-Gesu-al-Tempio-1024x781.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Presentation_of_Christ_in_the_Temple.jpg,,c. 1754,Painting,,39 × 52 cm,Sacred art,,17,"This Presentation of Christ in the Temple is based on the same subject painted by Veronese on the organ wings in the church of San Sebastiano in Venice. The scene contains some anachronisms, such as Saint Simeon who, with the exception of his headgear, is wearing the insignia of a Catholic bishop. Note that the cope and crosier are almost identical to those of the bishop we see in inv. 141. Scholars suggest that this can be dated to around 1754."
Portrait of Peter Leopold of Habsburg-Lorraine (later Leopold II),Anton Raphael Mengs (1728-1779),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Ritratto-di-Leopoldo-II-d-Asburgo-Lorena-Anton-Raphael-Mengs-831x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Peter_Leopold_of_Habsburg-Lorraine_(later_Leopold_II).jpg,,1770,Painting,,101 × 82 cm,Portrait,,18,"This painting is by Anton Raphael Mengs, a German painter who worked in the leading capitals of Europe and who is considered as one of the greatest exponents of neoclassicism. It portrays Peter Leopold, called “the wise”, the son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and brother of Emperor Joseph II, when he was grand duke of Tuscany, before he himself became emperor as Leopold II. A leading sovereign of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, he is shown here in a dignified but not haughty pose. On his chest we see a sash of white and red, the heraldic colours of the Habsburgs."
Portrait of Napoleon King of Italy,Andrea Appiani (1754-1817),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Andrea-Appiani-Ritratto-Napoleone-Re-Italia-776x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Napoleon_King_of_Italy.jpg,,c. 1806 - 1808,Painting,,59 × 45 cm,Portrait,,19,"On 26 May 1805, Napoleon was crowned King of Italy in the Duomo in Milan and, as such, he was portrayed by Andrea Appiani. The three-quarter-length portrait, which can now be seen in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, was the model for the Ambrosiana work, which experts suggest was made between 1806 and 1808. Despite the solemnity and official air created by the sumptuous insignia of the Kingdom of Italy, the naturalism and immediacy of the face are particularly remarkable."
Self Portrait,Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770-1844),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Bertel-Thorvaldsen-Autoritratto-446x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Self_Portrait.jpg,,c. 1810,Sculpture,,62 cm,Self Portrait,,18,"The Danish artist Bertel Thorvaldsen is considered to be one of the greatest Euro pean neoclassical sculptors. In this self portrait, he has shaped his face in the heroic style, and this is emphasised by its larger-than-life, semi-colossal dimensions. The inspiration from classical sculpture can also be seen in the elegantly wavy hair, which gives the portrait a sense of the ideal."
Portico in Ruins,Giovanni Migliara (1785-1837),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giovanni-Migliara-Portico-in-rovina-1024x908.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portico_in_Ruins.jpg,,c. 1810,Painting,,16.5 × 13 cm,Veduta,,Atrio di passaggio 1 piano,"This miniature in oil by Giovanni Migliara takes up the popular nineteenth-century representation of architecture in ruins (in this case, a portico, with a blazon and a sacred image)."

The statue, of semi-colossal proportions, takes inspiration from the idealised, heroic models of classical antiquity."
Napoleon Bonaparte’s gloves,NA,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Guanti-di-Napoleone-Bonaparte-834x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Napoleon_Bonaparte’s_gloves.jpg,,c. 1815,Object,,,,,8,"This pair of gloves, which have faded over time, belonged to Napoleon, and came to the Ambrosiana with the following handwritten note: “I, the undersigned, declare that the gloves in yellow dante [buckskin], attached hereto, and fastened by a cord, were given by my husband, Baron Giuseppe Cavalletti, equerry to Prince Eugenio, Viceroy of Italy, upon his return to his homeland after the Battle of Waterloo. He told me that he kept them in memory of Napoleon I, at whose side he fought in said battle, as he had in many others, during which he was given them, and had kept them ever since. Marta Cavalletti, 23 June 1860”. The Battle of Waterloo took place on 18 June 1815 and marked the definitive defeat of Napoleon, who was later exiled to the island of St Helena, where he died on 5 March 1821."
Apse of San Satiro and View of the Duomo,Giovanni Migliara (1785-1837),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giovanni-Migliara-Abside-di-San-Satiro-e-veduta-del-Duomo-782x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Apse_of_San_Satiro_and_View_of_the_Duomo.jpg,,c. 1820,Painting,,14 × 11 cm,Veduta,,Atrio di passaggio 1 piano,"This miniature in oil by Giovanni Migliara shows the present-day Via Falcone in a flamboyant manner, full of people, with the apse of the church of San Satiro and, in the background, the spires of the Duomo."

In the deed of donation to the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, the portrait is indicated as a “Symbol of Innocence”: it is thus an allegorical picture, as indeed the idealised look of the girl would suggest."
The Arco della Pace in Milan,Giovanni Migliara (1785-1837),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giovanni-Migliara-Arco-della-Pace-a-Milano-1024x773.jpg,ambrosiana_images/The_Arco_della_Pace_in_Milan.jpg,,c. 1835 - 1838,Painting,,47.9 × 63.5 cm,Veduta,,19,"Even though the painting bears a signature and date (Giò Migliara 1814), scholars are not unanimous in attributing the work to Giovanni Migliara. The construction of the Arco della Pace, or Arch of Peace, was begun in 1807 to celebrate Napoleon, but work stopped after his defeat at Waterloo in 1815. Building resumed in 1826 under the orders of Emperor Francis I of Austria, who wanted it to be dedicated to the peace that was established after 1815. It was eventually unveiled by his successor, Ferdinand I, in 1838. In the painting we see the arena, on the left, and the spires of the Duomo, on the right."

Dantesque window,Giuseppe Bertini (1825-1898),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Giuseppe-Bertini-Vetrata-dantesca-768x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Dantesque_window.jpg,,1851,Stained glass window,,700 × 290 cm,Arts and crafts,,21,"Made for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, this window was again shown in London to celebrate the sixth centenary of the birth of Dante in 1865. It was purchased for the Ambrosiana by public subscription in 1867. The poet is seated on a Gothic throne, flanked by the enigmatic Matilda and by Beatrice.
Above, three episodes from Hell are represented: on the right Dante, meets the three beasts that hinder his path out of the dark forest (canto I); in the center one can see the poet in a faint, overwhelmed by pity for the fate of Paolo and Francesca (canto V); finally, on the left the demon Flegiàs ferries Dante and Virgil on the Stygian swamp towards the fiery walls of the city of Dite (canto VIII).
On the sides of the scene taken from canto V, St. Dominic and St. Francis, founders of the mendicant orders, act almost as a mediation to the upper register, where the Virgin enthroned, dressed in white and venerated by angels, is depicted.
The author of this work, Giuseppe Bertini, created numerous stained glass windows for the Milan Cathedral."
Portrait of Emilia Morosini Zeltner,Francesco Hayez (1791-1882),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Francesco-Hayez-Ritratto-di-Emilia-Morosini-Zeltner-823x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Emilia_Morosini_Zeltner.jpg,,1852,Painting,,98 × 79 cm,Portrait,,19,"This painting was commissioned by Morosini Zeltner herself and sent to the annual exhibition of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in 1852. This noblewoman of Venetian origin was one of the protagonists of the Risorgimento in Milan, and it was indeed due to the uprising that she is shown in mourning: her son, Emilio Morosini, was one of the first to climb onto the barricades during the Five Days of Milan in 1848, and he joined the Lombard Bersaglieri in Piedmont, but in 1849 he died, aged just eighteen, from wounds received in battle. This was the first portrait of members of the Morosini and Negroni Prati families painted by Francesco Hayez."
Portrait of Giuseppina Negroni Prati Morosini,Francesco Hayez (1791-1882),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Francesco-Hayez-Ritratto-di-Giuseppina-Negroni-Prati-Morosini-802x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Giuseppina_Negroni_Prati_Morosini.jpg,,1853,Painting,,122 × 96 cm,Portrait,,19,"This portrait of Giuseppina Negroni Prati Morosini was commissioned by her husband, Count Alessandro, and shown at the annual exhibition of the Accademia di Belli Arti di Brera in 1853. Even so, despite the superb quality (see, for example, the luminous rendering of the face and the elegance of the ringed hand holding the half-open book), the two paintings were not particularly well received by critics. Giuseppina Morosini inherited her patriotism and passion for the Risorgimento from her mother, and shared it with her brother Emilio. She worked hard to help the fighters during the Five Days of Milan and, from 1849, her house became an authentic anti-Habsburg salon, with guests including Giuseppe Verdi, Andrea Verga, the founder of the Milanese school of psychiatry, as well as Francesco Hayez, whose memoirs she collected, and which were later published in 1890. This noblewoman was one of the cofounders of the political La Perseveranza newspaper in Milan in 1860."
Portrait of Alessandro Negroni Prati Morosini,Francesco Hayez (1791-1882),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Francesco-Hayez-Ritratto-di-Alessandro-Negroni-Prati-795x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Alessandro_Negroni_Prati_Morosini.jpg,,1853,Painting,,120 × 94 cm,Portrait,,19,"Shown at the annual exhibition of the Accademia di Belli Arti di Brera in 1853, this painting is a portrait of Count Alessandro Negroni Prati Morosini, the son-in-law of Giovanni Battista and Emilia Morosini. The portrait is notable for its realism and unadorned austerity."
Portrait of Giovanni Battista Morosini,Francesco Hayez (1791-1882),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Francesco-Hayez-Ritratto-di-Giovanni-Battista-Morosini-803x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Portrait_of_Giovanni_Battista_Morosini.jpg,,1854,Painting,,103 × 81 cm,Portrait,,19,"This portrait, which is signed and dated 1854, was commissioned by Morosini’s daughter (see inv. 1095) and shown at the Brera exhibition in 1859. The painter himself considered this as one of his most successful portraits, “both in likeness and workmanship”, and the elderly man, dressed in informal chamber attire, is indeed portrayed with great realism. Less sympathetic to the Risorgimento cause than his wife, Morosini handed over to the Austrian police the papers that the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kos´ciuszko (whose heart was kept as a relic by Zeltner) had left to Morosini Zeltner, in exchange for the promise of the title of Count, which was however never granted by the Austrian authorities."
Locked out of school,Emilio Longoni (1859-1932),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Emilio-Longoni-Chiusi-fuori-scuola-594x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Locked_out_of_school.jpg,,c. 1887 - 1888,Painting,,140 × 84 cm,Portrait,,19,"In this painting we see two little girls, shown life-size, who have been locked out of school: they are Maria and Centa Rossi, the daughters of the painter’s washerwoman. The work was shown at the Accademia di Brera in 1888, and it marks the painter’s turning point towards a more markedly social interest in his portrayal of real people. The psychological insight is quite remarkable in this painting: for the younger child, being locked out of school means being able to skip boring lessons, and is thus a reason to be pleased. However, in her elder sister, who is now approaching the first responsibilities in her life, we can see all the anxiety she feels when thinking of the consequences her lateness will have."
Washerwomen at the Canal,Emilio Gola (1851-1923),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Emilio-Gola-Le-lavandaie-sul-Naviglio-1024x736.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Washerwomen_at_the_Canal.jpg,,1893,Painting,,180 × 200 cm,Petit genre,,19,"This painting, which is dated 1893, gives us a view of the Naviglio, a very popular genre subject in those years. A number of figures are shown on the two banks of the canal by the gates of Milan. The water is seen at dawn (if, as seems likely, the setting is the Naviglio Grande) and it cuts across the composition diagonally, making it the ideal subject for the luministic and chromatic analysis that interested the painter. In terms of perspective, notice how the road markers on the left lead away to infinity, with the Duomo of Milan in the background."
Maternity,Mosè Bianchi (1840-1904),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Mose-Bianchi-Maternita-652x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Maternity.jpg,,1899,Painting,,72.5 × 47.5 cm,Petit genre,,19,"The painting, which is signed and dated (1899), dates from the maturity of the Monza-born master. A young woman is nursing her baby, tenderly gazing at him. The painting is dominated by light, the effect of which is amplified by the white dress of the mother and by the little sheet in which the baby is wrapped, and the entire scene is rendered with a style that achieves an interesting degree of realism through rapid brushstrokes."
Flowers and Roses,Gaetano Previati (1852-1920),https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Gaetano-Previati-Rose-1024x688.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Flowers_and_Roses.jpg,,1912,Painting,,34 × 50 cm,Petit genre,,19,"In this painting, flowers cover the entire surface and are characterised by their very intense colours. The work was made in 1912, when Previati took up divisionist painting, of which he was also a theorist."
Display case with the hair of Lucrezia Borgia,Alfredo Ravasco,https://ambrosiana.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ambrosiana-Capelli-di-Lucrezia-Borgia-1-695x1024.jpg,ambrosiana_images/Display_case_with_the_hair_of_Lucrezia_Borgia.jpg,,c. 1926 - 1928,Display case,,30 cm,,,8,"Documents show that, as early as 1685, the Ambrosiana had a lock of hair from Lucrezia Borgia (1480-1519), the daughter of Roderic, later Pope Alexander VI, who married Alfonso d’Este, Duke of Ferrara. It was kept together with nine letters, also in the Ambrosiana, written by Lucrezia to Pietro Bembo (1470-1547), the humanist cardinal and man of letters. This lock of blonde hair became an almost cult object for the Romantics in the nineteenth century, and it was housed, like a reliquary, in this display case made by Alfredo Ravasco, one of the finest goldsmiths in Milan in the first half of the century, with a combination of precious materials, hardstones and gems. The two pendants, with the heraldic emblems of the aristocratic Borgia (the bull) and d’Este (the eagle) families, are worthy of note."
